```javascript
// Solution to fix the unexpected floating behavior in Tailwind CSS

<div class="bg-red-500 p-4 overflow-x-auto">
  <div class="float-right">
    This div is now correctly floated to the right.
  </div>
</div>
```
By setting `overflow-x-auto` (or `overflow-hidden`), we ensure that the parent div correctly handles the floated child element, resolving the unexpected behavior.
